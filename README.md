# Mask-Distrillation-Network
This is an pytorch implementation of "Mask Distillation Network for Conjunctival Hyperemia Severity Classification".

# Purpose
To achieve automatic, fast and accurate classification of bulbar conjunctival hyperemia severity, we proposed a novel “different input but same output” framework called Mask Distillation Network (MDN).
